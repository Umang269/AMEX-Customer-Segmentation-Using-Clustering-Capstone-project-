**Machine Learning – AMEX Customer Segmentation Using Clustering (Capstone Project)** In this capstone project, I performed unsupervised learning on a credit card dataset of 8,950 American Express customers to identify distinct customer segments based on behavioral features such as purchases, cash advances, and payments. The project involved data cleaning, handling missing values, and applying feature transformation techniques. I explored and compared clustering algorithms including K-Means, DBSCAN, and Hierarchical Clustering, selecting the optimal model using the Elbow Method. The analysis revealed four key customer segments—high-value, high-risk, moderate, and inactive—providing actionable insights for targeted marketing strategies.
